### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I am Khadiravana (people find it easy to call me BVK which stands for **B**elagavi **V**iswanath **K**hadiravana). I am currently a master's student at IIIT Hyderabad working on developing data-frugal AI methods for document text recognition. 

I am also fortunate to be part of the BharatGPT team, which is an initiative by IIIT Hyderabad, IIT Bombay and IIT Kanpur to build open-source LLM tools for India.
